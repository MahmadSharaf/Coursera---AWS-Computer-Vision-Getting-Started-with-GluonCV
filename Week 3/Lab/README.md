Your objective in this assignment is to implement a tennis ball detector using a pre-trained image classification network from GluonCV. We'll step through the pipeline, from loading and transforming an input image, to loading and using a pre-trained model. Since we're only interested in detecting tennis balls, this is a binary classification problem, which is slightly different to the multi-class classification setup we've seen so far.
